Wireframe is included in the folder, it is a publisher file.


For this assignment, I have chosen to do a CV/ Resume based wesbite. I have chosen to do this particular task becuase I would like to use it track my achivements and focus on my long term goals, as well as using it as an actual CV when I apply for jobs in the summer.

#1.1.1
The background problem I am trying to solve is just for me to make sure that I am on the right track and doing the correct steps needed for my career in Software Engineering. As of recently I feel like my goals and ambitions have been faded and I would like to use this website to track my progress and making sure I am doing the things needed, whether that be learning a new programming language or improving my knowledge on the ones that I already do know. This is just a place for me to hld my self accountable and improve my self.

#1.1.2
Wireframes have been completed in Microsofot Publisher which should be included inside the zip folder.

#1.1.3
For the color scheme for this wesbite, I have chosen to use dark/black colors and give it a drak theme as I feel like dark themes give it a nice, neat and tidy feeling to it. It is easy to read and not distracting to the viewers.

#1.1.4
Accessibility- I have given alt tages to images

#1.2.5 GDPR

#1.2.6 Distance Selling
Not applicable

#1.2.7 Evaluation
I feel like I have a good base on what I wanted create. The main problem I encountered on the way was the Javascript carousel. Had I had more time, I would of made sure that the carousel was working, I would of added more content to the pages and layed it out more nearly. I would of also added a lot more styles and animations to the website to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
